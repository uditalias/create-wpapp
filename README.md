# create-wpapp
## A dead-simple webpack starter project generator


A new UI framework just came out, a new library, a new tool.. you want to test it but you need to config webpack in order to start.. ðŸ˜¤

There's lots of webpack app generators, but this one won't make you cry.

Like `create-react-app` which is awesome but very opinionated.. have you tried adding something to the `webpack.config.js` file? I know.. you must `eject` everything in order to do so.

What if all I want to do is just write my code!

- You want `babel` to transform your ES6 code? OK!
- You want TypeScript instead? OK!
- You want `react`? OK!
- You want to style your app with css? OK!
- You want to work with SCSS preprocessor? OK!!!

I put all my opinions aside and focus in simplicity.. and guess what? you don't need to eject anything in order to edit/add/remove something so you can just start to write your code! **THAT'S - IT!**

Creating a new webpack app in /Users/udidu/project...
...
All Done.
Run npm start to start the dev server
```

This will create a webpack project with dev server hmr in the following structure:

```
/project
    |- node_modules
    |- src
        |- style
            |- main.{css,scss}      // Based on your selection
        |- app.{js,ts,tsx}          // Based on your selection
    |- views
        |- index.html
    |- .gitignore
    |- package.json
    |- webpack.config.js
    |- tsconfig.json                // For a TypeScript project

```

Just run `npm start` to start the dev server.
